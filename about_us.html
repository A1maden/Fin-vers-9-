                <p class="about-greeting-text">Hello! Fresh Ideas is a Digital Creative Agency on a mission to turn the worst day of the week into the best one. We create joyful digital experiences and unique visual identities that tickle the brain, please the eyes and connect the hearts of brands to the hearts of their consumers.</p>

            <div class="about-main-row">
                <div class="about-main-column first-column">
                    <h2 class="about-main-colum-title ">What We Do</h2>
                    <p class="column-text">The real question is, what don't we do? For starters, we don't do dental anesthesia, upholstering, reed/wind instrument repairment and/or tuning, acupuncture, soil conservation, or beekeeping. Instead, we specialize in digital experiences and products across web, tablet and mobile devices.</p>
                    <p class="column-text">Sometimes we add an extra sentence or two to make sure that the copy aligns with the other columns. If you think this is a waste of time, just skip to our project section – that’s where the real magic happens.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="about-main-column second-column">
                    <h2 class="about-main-colum-title">What We Believe</h2>
                    <p class="column-text">A company without a philosophy is like a ship without a compass. Our agency is built on the premise that it is possible to make a creative playground rather than a production factory. The equation is simple: happy people create joyful digital experiences. </p>
                    <p class="column-text">We are lucky because we have 3 offices with many creative brains from different cultures that we smash together in a process called neural fusion (in contrast to neural fission). It releases an immense amount of creative energy - ƒ = n30n2 σv - that dissolves ego and hierarchy. The neural fusion theory is widely accepted in the non-scientific world.</p>

                <div class="about-main-column third-column">
                    <h2 class="about-main-colum-title">Who We Are</h2>
                    <p class="column-text">According to legend, he or she who can transform Monday into the best day of the week will be awarded with endless street credibility, balloons and a real sense of accomplishment. So we took the challenge and opened Hello Monday in 2006 in Aarhus, Denmark. </p>
                    <p class="column-text">The publicity was huge, people could not believe that Mondays could actually be great days. We, of course, did not want to be greedy with our winnings so we decided to spread the goodness and opened 2 more offices, one in Copenhagen and one in New York City. 3 offices, 36 Mondayteers, 2 thriving plants, and 1 dying plant. We are not sure what killed it.</p>

                <div class="about-main-column fourth-column">
                    <h2 class="about-main-colum-title">How We Work</h2>
                    <p class="column-text">Think of us as an extension of your team rather than a vendor. Working together is a beautiful love story where we meet, fall in love, communicate, set expectations, learn to trust each other, and work together as a team. As one of our time’s greatest philosophers and basketball players – Michael Jordan – says: “Talent wins games, but teamwork wins championships.” </p>
                    <p class="column-text">Our process is transparent and iterative, so you’ll always know when and why we are researching, brainstorming, concepting, sketching, designing and programming.</p>
